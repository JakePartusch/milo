title: '3 Months! '
subTitle: "And just like that we have a 3 month old!  Milo weighs nearly 17 lbs and continues to sleep through the night (typically 9pm to 6:30am).  He is extremely close to rolling over and has decided that tummy time is more fun if you are on your side.  He spends most of his days flashing us his big smiles and talking (if only we knew what he was saying). \U0001F60A  We love being Milo's mama and daddy!  Mama may have overdone it on the photos again, but how can you resist snapping photos of that grin?   "
