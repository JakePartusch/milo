subTitle: >-
  Milo had an exciting and busy first Halloween.  He had his first pajama day at
  school, and also unfortunately got hit with a toy giving him his first big
  bruise for Halloween photos.  When we got home we spent some time playing in
  the leaves before going to visit both sets of Grandparents in Springfield as
  well as his friend Elsie.
