title: Our Little Inch Worm
subTitle: "It is probably our fault for being on the go so much, but Milo has definitely gone away from his nap schedule.  He fought off sleep all day only getting a few small naps in here and there.  In other news, Milo is learning that he can slowly scoot his way around.  He is definitely not crawling, but has started to do somewhat of an inch worm motion.  He scoots his bum up, then tries to pull himself forward.  With lots of small movements and lots of heavy breathing he is slowly moving toward things.  We had a heart to heart today, and I told him he was too little to start crawling, I'm anxious to see if he listened.  \U0001F609"
