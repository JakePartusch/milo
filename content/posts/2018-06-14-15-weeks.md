  Milo has one tooth starting to peek through those gums, he is oh so close to
  rolling from his back to his tummy, and he loves to grab onto anything and
  everything. When there is nothing to grab onto, he just happily plays with his
  hands.  It is rare not to find those cute little fingers anywhere other than
  in his mouth or clasped at his chest.
