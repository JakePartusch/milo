  Milo had a fun filled Friday!  The morning started with Milo having a blow out
  all over mama, but we are happy to report it quickly got better from there! 
  Milo had a playdate, visited Lauritzen Gardens, went to El Bee's for dinner,
  and ended the night at Kros Strain Brewery with Uncle Noah.  We love exploring
  Omaha with our happy boy!
