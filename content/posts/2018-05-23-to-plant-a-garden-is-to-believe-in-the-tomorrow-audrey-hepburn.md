  Another night working in the backyard.  Mama worked in the garden, while Daddy
  worked on prepping the house for our new deck.  Milo was happy as usual
  (although some of dad's power tools were a bit scary) right up until he fell
  asleep. Also, is it possible to take too many photos of a smiling baby in a
  sunhat? I obviously don't think so :)
