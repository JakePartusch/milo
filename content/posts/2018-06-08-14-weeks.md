title: 14 Weeks!
subTitle: "We weren't expecting to have a teething baby at 14 weeks, but Milo is handling it like a champ (\U0001F91E\U0001F3FB it stays that way).  He is wanting to chew on everything, drools constantly, blows bubbles, and has started rubbing his tongue along his gums in the cutest way possible. Falling asleep is a lot more difficult when your teeth hurt! Hang in there buddy! "
