  Our Milo man is a total wiggle worm and is currently drooling up a storm.  Do
  they make arm bibs? Because we would really benefit from one!   I also
  realized when updating photos for today that I have LOTS of photos of Milo and
  Franklin together.  They just always kind of end up next to each other looking
  adorable...
