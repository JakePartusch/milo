title: 'Happy Birthday Franklin! '
subTitle: >-
  A day for celebrating!  Franklin is 2, Milo is 13 weeks, and Mama is home for
  the summer! It's a good day! Thanks for helping us celebrate and being our
  patient photographer, aunt Taylor! Be prepared for photo overload...
  unfortunately the boys refuse to ever be photogenic at the same time.
