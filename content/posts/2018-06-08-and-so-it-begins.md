subTitle: "We are pretty sure that Mr. Milo has started teething.  Apparently, when the teeth start coming you need both a pacifier and a hand to chew on. \U0001F60A    In other news, he spends majority of his summer mornings in just a diaper and the majority of his tummy time in this sideways position. He is still our happy little guy!  "
